### Notes:
- **Broilers** dominate in many southern and eastern states due to the high value of poultry production.
- **Cattle and calves** are prominent in the Great Plains and western states, reflecting extensive ranching.
- **Dairy products (milk)** lead in states with significant dairy industries, such as Wisconsin, California, and New York.
- **Corn** and **soybeans** are major in the Midwest, part of the Corn Belt, due to ideal growing conditions.
- **Nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, and sod** reflect high-value specialty production in smaller or more urbanized states.
- Specialty crops like **oranges** (Florida), **apples** (Washington), and **sugarcane** (Louisiana) highlight regional climate advantages.

This list reflects the most economically significant products as of recent data, though states often produce a diverse range of commodities. For instance, California is also a leader in almonds, grapes, and vegetables, but dairy consistently tops its cash receipts. If you need more detailed data or specific years, let me know!<\p>
